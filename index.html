          The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed
          as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer
          space distribution between items in an interface and powerful
          alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of the main
          features of flexbox, which we will be exploring in more detail in the
          rest of these guides.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we describe flexbox as being one dimensional we are describing
          the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time —
          either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the
          two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and
          rows together.

      <section id="The_two_axes_of_flexbox" class="main-section">
        <header>The two axes of flexbox</header>
        <p>
          When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes — the
          main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the
          flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.
          Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is
          worth understanding how they work from the outset.
        </p>
        <h1>The main axis</h1>
        <p>
          The main axis is defined by flex-direction, which has four possible
          values:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Row</li>
          <li>Row-reverse</li>
          <li>Column</li>
          <li>Column-reverse</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Should you choose row or row-reverse, your main axis will run along
          the row in the inline direction.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/flex-direction-row.png"
          alt="Main axis: flex row example"
        />
        <p>
          Choose column or column-reverse and your main axis will run from the
          top of the page to the bottom — in the block direction.
        </p>
        <img src="images/column.png" alt="Main axis: flex-column example" />
        <h2>The cross axis</h2>
        <p>
          The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your
          flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or row-reverse the cross axis
          runs down the columns.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/cross-axis-row.png"
          alt="Cross axis: flex-row example"
        />
        <p>
          If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs
          along the rows.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/cross-axis-column.png"
          alt="Cross axis: flex-column
        example "
        />
      </section>

      <section id="Start_and_end_lines" class="main-section">
        <header>Start and end lines</header>
        <p>
          Another vital area of understanding is how flexbox makes no assumption
          about the writing mode of the document. In the past, CSS was heavily
          weighted towards horizontal and left-to-right writing modes. Modern
          layout methods encompass the range of writing modes and so we no
          longer assume that a line of text will start at the top left of a
          document and run towards the right hand side, with new lines appearing
          one under the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the flex-direction is row and I am working in English, then the
          start edge of the main axis will be on the left, the end edge on the
          right.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/flex-direction-row.png"
          alt="Main axis: flex row example"
        />
        <p>
          If I were to work in Arabic, then the start edge of my main axis would
          be on the right and the end edge on the left.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/arabic-flex-direction.png"
          alt="Main axis: flex row example in arabic"
        />

        <header>The flex container</header>
        <p>
          An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a flex
          container. To create a flex container, we set the value of the area's
          container's display property to flex or inline-flex. As soon as we do
          this the direct children of that container become flex items. As with
          all properties in CSS, some initial values are defined, so when
          creating a flex container all of the contained flex items will behave
          in the following way.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Items display in a row (the flex-direction property's default is
            row).
          </li>
          <li>The items start from the start edge of the main axis.</li>
          <li>
            The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink.
          </li>
          <li>The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis.</li>
          <li>The flex-basis property is set to auto.</li>
          <li>The flex-wrap property is set to nowrap.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example-flex-container">
          <div>1</div>
          <div>2</div>
          <div>3</div>
          <code>
